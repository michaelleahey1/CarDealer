Went over several exceptions most were runtime exceptions. Important to note exceptions are not always errors.always.
I like the fact we are going over what can go wong, in my opinion that was missing. We intertwined old Java we
already went over in conjunction with new information.
For example, this example went over OOP again. By adding extends uses inheritance, which is one of the 5 pillars we learned
The 5 pillars are subjective some say 3 or 4 but we learned there are 5 pillars
1) Composition
2) Abstraction
3) Inheritance
4) Polymorphism
5) Encapsulation
We also used encapsulation, because the objects in CarDealer and Main classes use the encapsulation catch phrases
(public) and (private).
You can also say we used polymorphism was used because although not always necessary inheritance, which works hand
in hand with polymorphism.
